# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

# Line 1 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. 
#For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

#in Siv, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
