# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#bmi = weight /height * height 

# 1st input: enter height in meters e.g: 1.65
height = input()
# 2nd input: enter weight in kilograms e.g: 72
weight = input()
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
bmi = float( weight) / float(height) **2
print(round(bmi))
